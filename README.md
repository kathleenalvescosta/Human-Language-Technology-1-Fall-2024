# Human-Language-Technology-1-Fall-2024
This repository includes the assignments and projects associated with my HLT 1 class at the University of Arizona.
The following information has been sourced directly from the course syllabus (written by Dr. Gus Hahn-Poweel at the University of Arizona):

**Course Information**

This class serves as an introduction to human language technology (HLT), an
emerging interdisciplinary field that encompasses most subdisciplines of linguistics, as well as computational linguistics, natural language processing, computer
science, artificial intelligence, psychology, philosophy, mathematics, and statistics. Content includes a combination of theoretical and applied topics such as
(but not limited to) tokenization across languages, n-grams, word representations, basic probability theory, introductory programming, and version control.

**Course Objectives**

In this course, we will . . .

• cover fundamental concepts related to human language technology, such as . . .

    – tokens and their attributes
    
    – text normalization techniques
    
    – tokenization and regular expressions
    
    – character and word n-grams
    
    – basics of probability theory
    
    – representing words and documents as vectors
    
    – vector-based comparisons

• foster technical skills, such as . . .

    – linux command line basics
    
    – virtualization and Containerization technologies
    
    – version control (ex. git) and the feature branch workflow


**Expected Learning Outcomes**

Successful students will be able to . . .

• write simple programs ≤ 50 lines of code

• use a version control system to manage repositories1

• set up a Linux-based development environment

• calculate the similarity of pairs of vectors

• build a simple tokenizer

• represent words and documents as vectors
• estimate the probability of a word in a corpus
